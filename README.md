### `index.html`
The HTML file consists of several sections:
- **Header Section**: Displays a welcome message.
- **Form Section**: A registration form where users can input their first name, last name, email, and mobile number.
- **Table Section**: Displays a table of common user information.
- **Image Section**: Contains an image representing the community.
- **Footer**: Provides an external link to a different website (Google in this case).

### `styles.css`
The CSS file is used to style the HTML page, making it visually appealing. It utilizes various CSS properties such as:
- **`font-family`**: Sets the font for the webpage.
- **`color`** and **`background-color`**: Defines text and background colors.
- **`margin`** and **`padding`**: Adds spacing to elements.
- **`border`**: Adds borders around elements like tables and inputs.
- **`text-align`**: Aligns text within elements.

## CSS Features
